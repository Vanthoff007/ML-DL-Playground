# Simple Two-Layer Neural Network for Digit Classification

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a simple two-layer neural network for digit classification using the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) by utilizing only Numpy. The neural network architecture is as follows:

- **Input Layer**: 784 units (28x28 pixels for each input image).
- **Hidden Layer**: 10 units with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: 10 units with softmax activation, corresponding to the ten-digit classes (0-9).

## Setup

You only need Numpy and Pandas for the task. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```
