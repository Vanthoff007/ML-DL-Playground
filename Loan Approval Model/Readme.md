## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on the applicant's information. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of features and relationships between them.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features that might improve model performance.
4. Model Building: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best one.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of features related to the applicant's financial and personal information. Key features include income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, we:

- Handle missing values using imputation techniques.
- Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- Scale numerical features to bring them to a common scale.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA section includes:

- Visualizing the distribution of key features.
- Analyzing correlations between features and the target variable.
- Identifying potential outliers.

## Modeling

We experiment with several machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the models.

## Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

The confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve are also analyzed.

## Conclusion

The final model's performance is summarized, and potential improvements are discussed. The results demonstrate the model's capability to accurately predict loan status.
